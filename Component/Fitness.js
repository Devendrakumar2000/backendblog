        "BlogContent": "Parts of this emerging running culture harken back to the running boom of the 1970s, when for the first time, average people were running casually en masse. Or, as many called it back then, jogging.But soon after jogging came into style in the '70s—replete with pastel shorts and matching sweatbands—the term “jogger” began to turn derogatory, thanks at least in part to serious runners who felt the need to distinguish themselves from the new swarms of recreational ones.“Somewhere along the line, ‘jogger’ became pejorative,” says Mark Remy, a former Runner’s World editor and the founder of dumbrunner.com.

        "BlogContent": "Cycling is a great way to burn calories in a low impact manner and it’s easy on the joints. For beginners, it can also help them strengthen their leg muscles and also work on overall cardiovascular health. I am a huge proponent of performing cardio in indirect forms such as cycling as it’s super fun. We should start slow and taper up as skills improve. We can also motivate our friends and family to use cycles instead of cars to save fuel, protect the environment and even improve our own health. Cycling is not the be all and end all when it comes to exercise, but it is a great way to make exercising efficient and fun!” states Yash Vardhan Swami, health and fitness expert.",

        "BlogContent": "Morning is considered the most productive, energetic and positive time of the day as one is usually fresh after a good night's sleep. Setting a morning routine not only helps you structure your day better but also contribute to your overall well-being. It's true that the first thing you do after waking up can define the rest of your day. Experts say checking phone or emails right early morning can trigger a stress response while a bit of self care at the start of the day could bring many benefits. While most of us have hectic routines, one doesn't need more than 5-10 minutes to set the correct tone for the day and meditation can be one of the effective practices that may help you achieve that..",
