The film brought back Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire back as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and it was spectacular to see them team up with Tom Holland. One other surprise the film gave us was the reintroduction of Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock/Daredevil. Even though he didn't suit up as the vigilante and team-up with Spider-Man, his cameo was one of the highlights of the film. One fan thinks that they should have given us a peak at the film version of the Daredevil costume and has even taken the liberty of designing his own interpretation. ",
